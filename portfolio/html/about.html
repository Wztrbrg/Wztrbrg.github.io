          My name is Jonathan, and I'm a front-end developer student with a
          passion for design. I have aquired lots of experience in both
          front-end and back-end development on my journey, and I'm always
          looking for new and exciting projects to work on.
        </p>
        <p class="about-para">
          Throughout my studies, I've had the opportunity to participate in a
          wide range of projects, both with teams and independently. I take
          pride in delivering high-quality work that exceeds my clients'
          expectations, and I'm constantly striving to improve my skills and
          learn new things.
        </p>
        <p class="about-para">
          When I'm not working on projects, you can usually find me outdoors
          with my family or just playing some video games. I believe that
          maintaining a healthy work-life balance is essential for staying
          motivated and productive, and I try to prioritize my mental and
          physical health in everything I do.
        </p>
        <p class="about-para">
          Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. If
          you're interested in working together on a project or have any
          questions, please don't hesitate to reach out!
