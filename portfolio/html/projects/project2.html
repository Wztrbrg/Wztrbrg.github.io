          Simple travel planner built with vanilla JavaScript
        </h3>
        <p class="main-para">
          The Travel Planner is a web app that allows users to plan their train
          travel between a starting and ending destination. Built using
          JavaScript, HTML, and Bootstrap, this project is an excellent example
          of how to build a functional application that utilizes an API to
          provide real-time information to users.

        <h3 class="main-subhead">Uses an API</h3>
        <p class="main-para">
          The main features of the app include the ability for users to enter a
          starting and ending destination and receive a list of available times
          to travel by train. The app uses an API to access real-time train
          schedules, making it easy for users to plan their trips effectively.

        <h3 class="main-subhead">My role</h3>
        <p class="main-para">
          As the sole developer of the project, my responsibilities included
          designing and developing the front-end user interface, as well as
          writing the back-end code to interface with the API and display the
          relevant travel information to the user. I also ensured that the
          application was responsive and could be used on a variety of devices.
          The goal of the project was to demonstrate my proficiency in
          JavaScript and showcase my ability to build a functional web app from
          scratch. By creating this project, I was able to hone my skills in web
          development and gain valuable experience in utilizing APIs to provide
          real-time information to users. Overall, the Travel Planner was a
          school project that I am proud to include in my portfolio. It is a
          great example of my ability to build a functional web app that
          utilizes APIs to provide real-time information to users.
