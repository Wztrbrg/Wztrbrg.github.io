          This Todo App is a web page that allows users to create, manage and
          delete todo items. Built using React, this project is a great example
          of how to build a simple, yet functional application using modern web
          technologies.

      <section>
        <h3 class="main-subhead">How it works</h3>
        <p class="main-para">
          The main features of the app include the ability to write a todo item,
          check it as completed, and delete all checked items. The app also
          saves the todo items in local storage, making it easy for users to
          return to their list at a later time.
        </p>

        <h3 class="main-subhead">My role</h3>
        <p class="main-para">
          As the sole developer of the project, my responsibilities included
          designing and developing the front-end user interface, as well as
          writing the back-end code for saving and managing todo items in local
          storage. I also ensured that the application was responsive and could
          be used on a variety of devices.

        <h3 class="main-subhead">My goal</h3>
        <p class="main-para">
          The goal of the project was to demonstrate my proficiency in React and
          showcase my ability to build a functional application from scratch. By
          creating this project, I was able to hone my skills in React and gain
          valuable experience in front-end web development. Overall, the React
          Todo App was a school/hobby project that I am proud to include in my
          portfolio. It is a great example of my ability to build a simple, yet
          effective application using modern web technologies.
